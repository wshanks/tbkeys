# tbkeys

`tbkeys` is a bootstrapped extension for Thunderbird that uses
[Mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice) to bind key sequences to custom
commands. Currently, it supports no customization and has hard-coded
keybindings similar to the ones available in Google's GMail web app.
[dorando-keyconfig](https://github.com/trlkly/dorando-keyconfig) is an example
of an extension that allows custom keybindings and supports customization but
does not currently work with Thunderbird 68.

## Current keybindings

| --- | -------- |
|  c  | Compose new message  |
